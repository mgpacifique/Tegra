As part of E-Lab's mission to nurture digital literacy and innovation, we created **Tegra**, a blended platform designed to:
- Guide high school students in Rwanda toward tech careers
- Offer mentorship through school-based clubs
- Provide digital resources and role model stories
- Bridge the gap between education and career opportunities
- Support personalized career guidance across STEM and economics fields

💡 Our approach is both digital and community-driven, aiming to unlock opportunities even for those who can't access platforms like ALX.
