# 🌍 E-Lab Journey Website - Impact Squad

Welcome to our official **E-Lab Digital Print** website repository!

This site was built as part of the **E-Lab Web Design Challenge**, aimed at documenting and showcasing our innovation journey, our team — **Impact Squad**, and the project we've passionately built to empower young Rwandans through tech career guidance.

## 🔥 About the Project

As part of E-Lab’s mission to nurture digital literacy and innovation, we created **Tegra**, a blended platform designed to:
- Guide high school students in Rwanda toward tech careers.
- Offer mentorship through school-based clubs.
- Provide digital resources and role model stories.

💡 Our approach is both digital and community-driven, aiming to unlock opportunities even for those who can’t access platforms like ALX.
